this is a React app to demonstrate my skills in reactjs.
The store gets its data from the https://fakestoreapi.com/,  this api serves data regarding products.
In this project i have created an UI that represents the data and fetches the category of products selected in the side bar.
there is a cart which holds the selected products and displays the total price. 
this app is only optimised for use on laptops and desktops. the layout dosent work on mobile devices.
